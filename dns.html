    <br><h1 class="text-center"> DNS </h1><br>
    <p class="text-justify">The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources. Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Each domain can correspond to more than one IP address. In fact, some sites have hundreds or more IP addresses that correspond with a single domain name. For example, the server your computer reaches for www.google.com is likely completely different from the server that someone in another country would reach by typing the same site name into their browser. Another reason for the distributed nature of the directory is the amount of time it would take for you to get a response when you were looking for a site if there was only one location for the directory, shared among the millions, probably billions, of people also looking for information at the same time. Thatâ€™s one long line to use the phone book.</p>
    <br><br><img src="images\dns.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="..."><br><br>
    <p class="text-justify">DNS is on the verge of one of its biggest shifts in its history. Google and Mozilla, who together control the lion's share of the browser market, are encouraging a move towards DNS over HTTPS, or DoH, in which DNS requests are encrypted by the same HTTPS protocol that already protects most web traffic. In Chrome's implementation, the browser checks to see if the DNS servers support DoH, and if they don't, it reroutes DNS requests to Google's 8.8.8.8.

        It's a move not without controversy. Paul Vixie, who did much of the early work on the DNS protocol back in the 1980s, calls the move a "disaster" for security: corporate IT will have a much harder time monitoring or directing DoH traffic that traverses their network, for instance. Still, Chrome is omnipresent and DoH will soon be turned on by default, so we'll see what the future holds.</p>
