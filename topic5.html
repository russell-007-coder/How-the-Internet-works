    <br><h1 class="text-center"> W3C HTML and CSS </h1><br>
    <p class="text-justify">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international organization committed to improving the web. It is made up of several hundred member organizations from a variety of related IT industries. W3C sets standards for the World Wide Web (WWW) to facilitate interoperability and cooperation among all web stakeholders. It was established in 1994 by the creator of the WWW, Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Founded in 1994 by the inventor of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, W3C has successfully overseen processes of issue raising, design, consensus building and testing resulting in over 335 technical standards that make the Web work. Success stories include HTML5, XML, CSS and Web accessibility guidelines. The Members and Staff of W3C, and its partners, are creating many more technologies that are designed to enable all Web users, from the elderly to the youngest generations, to share knowledge, expand commerce, and innovate.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

        HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

        When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland. He came up with the idea of an Internet-based hypertext system.

        Hypertext means a text that contains references (links) to other texts that viewers can access immediately. He published the first version of HTML in 1991, consisting of 18 HTML tags. Since then, each new version of the HTML language came with new tags and attributes (tag modifiers) to the markup.

        Due to a quick rise in popularity, HTML is now considered an official web standard. The HTML specifications are maintained and developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). You can check out the latest state of the language anytime on W3C’s website.</p>

    <br><br><img src="images\topic5.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="..."><br><br>

    <p class="text-justify">Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

        CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

        CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">CSS is created and maintained through a group of people within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. The CSS Working Group creates documents called specifications. When a specification has been discussed and officially ratified by the W3C members, it becomes a recommendation.

        These ratified specifications are called recommendations because the W3C has no control over the actual implementation of the language. Independent companies and organizations create that software.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Cascading Style Sheets level 1 (CSS1) came out of W3C as a recommendation in December 1996. This version describes the CSS language as well as a simple visual formatting model for all the HTML tags.

        CSS2 became a W3C recommendation in May 1998 and builds on CSS1. This version adds support for media-specific style sheets e.g. printers and aural devices, downloadable fonts, element positioning and tables.</p>
