    <h1 class="text-center"> IP Addresses, Packets and Routing </h1><br>
    <p class="text-justify">An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.  IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">IP addresses are not random. They are mathematically produced and allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), a division of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is a non-profit organization that was established in the United States in 1998 to help maintain the security of the internet and allow it to be usable by all. Each time anyone registers a domain on the internet, they go through a domain name registrar, who pays a small fee to ICANN to register the domain.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">IP (Internet Protocol) is a network layer protocol that has to do with routing. It is used to make sure packets arrive at the correct destination. Packets are sometimes defined by the protocol they are using. A packet with an IP header can be referred to as an "IP packet." An IP header contains important information about where a packet is from (its source IP address), where it is going (destination IP address), how large the packet is, and how long network routers should continue to forward the packet before dropping it. It may also indicate whether or not the packet can be fragmented, and include information about reassembling fragmented packets.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">Network routing is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation. In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination. These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Routers refer to internal routing tables to make decisions about how to route packets along network paths. A routing table records the paths that packets should take to reach every destination that the router is responsible for. Think of train timetables, which train passengers consult to decide which train to catch. Routing tables are like that, but for network paths rather than trains. Routers work in the following way: when a router receives a packet, it reads the headers* of the packet to see its intended destination, like the way a train conductor may check a passenger's tickets to determine which train they should go on. It then determines where to route the packet based on information in its routing tables.</p>
