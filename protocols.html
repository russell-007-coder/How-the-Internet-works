    <h1 class="text-center"> HTTP and HTTPS protocols </h1><br>
    <p class="text-justify">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Information is exchanged between clients and servers in the form of Hypertext documents, from which HTTP gets its name. Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links, or hyperlinks, between nodes containing text. Hypertext documents can be manipulated using the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Using HTTP and HTML, clients can request different kinds of content (such as text, images, video, and application data) from web and application servers that host the content.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">HTTP follows a request‑response paradigm in which the client makes a request and the server issues a response that includes not only the requested content, but also relevant status information about the request. This self‑contained design allows for the distributed nature of the Internet, where a request or response might pass through many intermediate routers and proxy servers. It also allows intermediary servers to perform value‑added functions such as load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.</p>

    <br><br><img src="images\protocols.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="..."><br><br>
    <p class="text-justify">HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the protocol where encrypted HTTP data is transferred over a secure connection. By using secure connection such as Transport Layer Security or Secure Sockets Layer, the privacy and integrity of data are maintained and authentication of websites is also validated.</p>
    <p class="text-justify"> HTTPS ensures data security over the network - mainly public networks like Wi-Fi. HTTP is not encrypted and is vulnerable to attackers who are eavesdropping and can gain access to website database and sensitive information. By virtue, HTTPS encryption is done bi-directionally, which means that the data is encrypted at both the client and server sides. Only the client can decode the information that comes from the server. So, HTTPS does encryption of data between a client and a server, which protects against eavesdropping, forging of information and tampering of data. But how do you ensure if you are seeing an HTTPS-enabled web page? Just check the address bar that carries the site name against different background colours with a lock icon at the left corner. However, this design can be different for different browsers. For example, consider going to a bank website, say hdfcbank.com. A non-secured HTTP will open up. But when we go to the login page, we can see an HTTPS in the address bar with some specific design. </p>
    <p class="text-justify">Implementation: HTTPS is mainly used by those websites which deal with monetary transactions or transfer user's personal data which could be highly sensitive. Banking websites are common examples. In layman's terms, HTTPS ensures that users watch websites that they want to watch. Data exchanged between the user and the website is not read, stolen or tampered with by a third party. But it can't encrypt everything - it has some limitations too. For example, HTTPS can't encrypt host addresses and port numbers.</p>
