    <h1 class="text-center"> The Dot Com Bubble </h1><br>
    <p class="text-justify">In 1990, Amazon and eBay were considered the most sparkling and shining bursts. Like any other famous company, idea of an online bookstore under the name “Amazon” started in a garage in Seattle. The idea came from the Jeff Bezos, a Wall Street guy, who was highly organized and inquisitive being and a spreadsheet enthusiast, who was doing the task. With the popularity of internet and millions of users using it in every possible part of the planet, this was an idea which cannot go down or flop.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">One of the success reasons for Amazon or eBay, is the Internet. And a supporting concept, which came into great importance is, Moore’s law. Gordon Moore, Co-Founder, Intel, created this law approximately around five decades ago. It is the observation which states that the number of transistors in a given dense IC doubles in, more or less, two years. This logic of Moore’s law has helped room-sized computers to reduce to hand-held robust systems. Where we can understand that, the density increases as the size of transistors decreases.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">With Internet spreading like wild fire, Bezos and Omidyar started to create new models of commerce, or we can say E-Commerce. With the integration of Internet and emerging popularity of nimble, affordable and robust personal computers, they commercialized their initial idea and took a step forward, which proved to be a golden one for them.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The idea of bookstore was simple. His views and key points summarized to a point that no library or bookstore can store every book present in this planet. Approximately, during the same timeline, Pierre Omidyar, just like any other coder, had a creative mind. He had an idea of building a site, where people can auction goods. Post Labour Day, later in around 1995, he started creating just a simple code in which we can create an advertisement, list up all the similar ones and bid in similar items of others like actual usual auctions happen, but in a virtual manner. At the time of their initiation of start-ups, we can observe that, Bezos had a very commercial mind and Omidyar, well, he was, earlier said, just a humble coder.</p>
    <br><br><img src="Images\dotcom.jpg" class="d-block w-100" alt="..."><br><br>
    <p class="text-justify">As every Parent see their children as perfect in every manner. Likewise, Amazon considered its bookstore services to be of top quality. Any new business has to face initial losses and sacrifice many opportunities and profits at times. Similar to that, Bezos rightfully said that, actually, his fundamental focus was not profit, to result in favour of rapid growth and profit. This was Bezos’ strategy which result to one getting a business bigger and faster, at a faster pace, a very fast pace. This thought of his made him think it was definitely important to grow to a particular level of excellency to satisfy and maintain customers for a longer time period, maximizing the chance the customers do not churn.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">Now focusing on the most important part, THE DOT COM BUBBLE. This bubble to inflate in 1997, reached its level in 2000 and was ultimately burst down in 2002. Here we can see that, the bubble started inflating has investments rose. Investments were rising because of the progress in the Internet, and the investments went higher and higher to the zenith. The main centre of attention were the tech companies. The main issue that came up was, nobody paid a heed to companies’ performance and progress. It is like a kid seeing a balloon, getting excited and not knowing that it will ultimately deflate or burst out. Common sense was no more common in this time period and blind investment was taking place every day, literally every day. The investors had a view, that companies having application with respect to the Internet will ultimately grow.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">As we discussed about the inflating balloon, the prices rose approximately around five times. Then, the slow deflating balloon came between 2000 to 2002. And finally had to burst out in 2002. Well, one of the reasons the bubble burst is the 9/11 Attack, which was a news and is still considered a turning point.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">While we read, we understand that, there were many companies that died. Investors were facing a huge loss, like literally a huge loss. Where we can see the bad side of this happening, there was a good side, for some. Amazon’s loss was present, but gradually, the revenue of this enormous company increased exponentially. To elaborate, the stock price of Amazon after this period dropped drastically. But later on, the same stock price increased approximately 100 times. Thus, in the end, we can that, this example of bubble burst proved to be a huge lesson of human nature for every person who has faced it.</p>
